# Sales Analysis and Forecasting

## Objective
Analyze sales data to identify trends, perform forecasting, and generate insights for business decision-making.

### Dataset
You can either create a sample sales dataset or use publicly available datasets. The dataset should include columns such as:
- Date of sale
- Product ID
- Product name
- Quantity sold
- Unit price
- Total sales amount
- Customer information (optional)

## Tasks

1. Data Entry and Cleaning:
- Input the sales data into an Excel worksheet.
- Clean the data by removing duplicates, correcting errors, and formatting the data appropriately.

2. PivotTables:
- Create PivotTables to summarize sales data by:
- Total sales amount by product and month.
- Total sales amount by customer and month.
- Quantity sold by product category.

3. Conditional Formatting:
- Apply conditional formatting to highlight:
- Top-selling products.
- Sales trends over time.

4. Macros:
- Record a macro to automate repetitive tasks, such as formatting PivotTables or generating reports.

5. OFFSET:
- Use the OFFSET function to create dynamic ranges for PivotTables or charts.

6. Power Pivot:
- Import the sales data into Power Pivot.
- Create relationships between tables (e.g., sales data and product information).
- Use DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to calculate additional metrics (e.g., sales growth rate, cumulative sales).

7. Filters:
- Apply filters to analyze sales data based on specific criteria (e.g., product category, customer segment, time period).

8. IFERROR:
- Use the IFERROR function to handle errors in formulas or calculations.

9. INDEX MATCH:
- Use INDEX MATCH to retrieve product information based on product ID.

10. COUNTIF and SUMIF:
- Use COUNTIF and SUMIF functions to count or sum sales based on specific conditions (e.g., count of sales greater than a certain amount, sum of sales for a particular product category).

11. Data Validation:
- Implement data validation to ensure accurate data entry (e.g., restrict input to predefined lists, set date ranges).

12. Power Query:
- Use Power Query to clean and transform data (e.g., remove unnecessary columns, merge datasets).

13. Data Manipulation:
- Perform additional data manipulation tasks as needed (e.g., calculating profit margins, segmenting customers based on purchase behavior).

14. Analysis and Reporting:
- Analyze the insights gained from the sales data (e.g., best-selling products, seasonal trends, customer preferences).
- Create visualizations (e.g., charts, graphs) to present key findings.
- Generate a sales forecast based on historical data using Excel's forecasting tools or regression analysis.
